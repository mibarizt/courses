                 <h1>Interventions by the United States in Latin America</h1>
                 <p>1846 The U.S., fulfilling the doctrine of Manifest Destiny, goes to war with 
                   Mexico and ends up with a third of Mexico's territory. </p>
                 <p>1850, 1853, 1854, 1857 U.S. interventions in Nicaragua. </p>
                 <p>1855 Tennessee adventurer William Walker and his mercenaries take over Nicaragua, 
                   institute forced labor, and legalize slavery. </p>
                 <p>1856 First of five U.S. interventions in Panama to protect the Atlantic-Pacific 
                   railroad from Panamanian nationalists. </p>
                 <p>1898 U.S. declares war on Spain, blaming it for destruction of the Maine. (In 
                   1976, a U.S. Navy commission will conclude that the explosion was probably an 
                   accident.) The war enables the U.S. to occupy Cuba, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the 
                   Philippines. </p>
                 <p>1903 The Platt Amendment inserted into the Cuban constitution grants the U.S. 
                   the right to intervene when it sees fit. When negotiations with Colombia break 
                   down, the U.S. sends ten warships to back a rebellion in Panama in order to 
                   acquire the land for the Panama Canal. The Frenchman Philippe Bunau-Varilla 
                   negotiates the Canal Treaty and writes Panama's constitution. </p>
                 <p>1904 U.S. sends customs agents to take over finances of the Dominican Republic 
                   to assure payment of its external debt. </p>
                 <p>1905 U.S. Marines help Mexican dictator Porfirio D&iacute;az crush a strike 
                   in Sonora. </p>
                 <p>1905 U.S. troops land in Honduras for the first of 5 times in next 20 years. </p>
                 <p>1906 Marines occupy Cuba for two years in order to prevent a civil war. </p>
                 <p>1907 Marines intervene in Honduras to settle a war with Nicaragua. </p>
                 <p>1908 U.S. troops intervene in Panama for first of 4 times in next decade. </p>
                 <p>1909 Liberal President Jos&eacute; Santos Zelaya of Nicaragua proposes that 
                   American mining and banana companies pay taxes; he has also appropriated church 
                   lands and legalized divorce, done business with European firms, and executed 
                   two Americans for participating in a rebellion. Forced to resign through U.S. 
                   pressure. The new president, Adolfo D&iacute;az, is the former treasurer of 
                   an American mining company. </p>
                 <p>1910 U.S. Marines occupy Nicaragua to help support the D&iacute;az regime. </p>
                 <p>1911 The Liberal regime of Miguel D&aacute;vila in Honduras has irked the State 
                   Department by being too friendly with Zelaya and by getting into debt with Britain. 
                   He is overthrown by former president Manuel Bonilla, aided by American banana 
                   tycoon Sam Zemurray and American mercenary Lee Christmas, who becomes commander-in-chief 
                   of the Honduran army. </p>
                 <p>1912 U.S. Marines intervene in Cuba to put down a rebellion of sugar workers. </p>
                 <p>1912 Nicaragua occupied again by the U.S., to shore up the inept D&iacute;az 
                   government. An election is called to resolve the crisis: there are 4000 eligible 
                   voters, and one candidate, D&iacute;az. The U.S. maintains troops and advisors 
                   in the country until 1925. </p>
                 <p>1914 U.S. bombs and then occupies Veracruz, in a conflict arising out of a 
                   dispute with Mexico's new government. President Victoriano Huerta resigns. </p>
                 <p>1915 U.S. Marines occupy Haiti to restore order, and establish a protectorate 
                   which lasts till 1934. The president of Haiti is barred from the U.S. Officers' 
                   Club in Port-au-Prince, because he is black. </p>
                 <p>1916 Marines occupy the Dominican Republic, staying till 1924. </p>
                 <p>1916 Pancho Villa, in the sole act of Latin American aggression against the 
                   U.S, raids the city of Columbus, New Mexico, killing 17 Americans. </p>
                 <p>1917 U.S. troops enter Mexico to pursue Pancho Villa. They can't catch him. </p>
                 <p>1917 Marines intervene again in Cuba, to guarantee sugar exports during WWI. </p>
                 <p>1918 U.S. Marines occupy Panamanian province of Chiriqui for two years to maintain 
                   public order. </p>
                 <p>1921 President Coolidge strongly suggests the overthrow of Guatemalan President 
                   Carlos Herrera, in the interests of United Fruit. The Guatemalans comply. </p>
                 <p>1925 U.S. Army troops occupy Panama City to break a rent strike and keep order. </p>
                 <p>1926 Marines, out of Nicaragua for less than a year, occupy the country again, 
                   to settle a volatile political situation. Secretary of State Kellogg describes 
                   a &quot;Nicaraguan-Mexican-Soviet&quot; conspiracy to inspire a &quot;Mexican-Bolshevist 
                   hegemony&quot; within striking distance of the Canal. </p>
                 <p>1929 U.S. establishes a military academy in Nicaragua to train a National Guard 
                   as the country's army. Similar forces are trained in Haiti and the Dominican 
                   Republic. </p>
                 <p>1930 Rafael Leonidas Trujillo emerges from the U.S.-trained National Guard 
                   to become dictator of the Dominican Republic. </p>
                 <p>1932 The U.S. rushes warships to El Salvador in response to a communist-led 
                   uprising. President Mart&iacute;nez, however, prefers to put down the rebellion 
                   with his own forces, killing over 8000 people (the rebels had killed about 100). </p>
                 <p>1933 President Roosevelt announces the Good Neighbor policy</p>
                 <p>1933 Marines finally leave Nicaragua, unable to suppress the guerrilla warfare 
                   of General Augusto C&eacute;sar Sandino. Anastasio Somoza Garc&iacute;a becomes 
                   the first Nicaraguan commander of the National Guard. </p>
                 <p>1933 Roosevelt sends warships to Cuba to intimidate Gerardo Machado y Morales, 
                   who is massacring the people to put down nationwide strikes and riots. Machado 
                   resigns. The first provisional government lasts only 17 days; the second Roosevelt 
                   finds too left-wing and refuses to recognize. A pro-Machado counter-coup is 
                   put down by Fulgencio Batista, who with Roosevelt's blessing becomes Cuba's 
                   new strongman. </p>
                 <p>1934 Platt Amendment repealed. </p>
                 <p>1934 Sandino assassinated by agents of Somoza, with U.S. approval. Somoza assumes 
                   the presidency of Nicaragua two years later. To block his ascent, Secretary 
                   of State Cordell Hull explains, would be to intervene in the internal affairs 
                   of Nicaragua. </p>
                 <p>1936 U.S. relinquishes rights to unilateral intervention in Panama. </p>
                 <p>1941 Ricardo Adolfo de la Guardia deposes Panamanian president Arias in a military 
                   coup— first clearing it with the U.S. Ambassador. </p>
                 <p>1943 The editor of the Honduran opposition paper El Cronista is summoned to 
                   the U.S. embassy and told that criticism of the dictator Tiburcio Car&iacute;as 
                   Andino is damaging to the war effort. Shortly afterward, the paper is shut down 
                   by the government. </p>
                 <p>1944 The dictator Maximiliano Hern&aacute;ndez Mart&iacute;nez of El Salvador 
                   is ousted by a revolution; the interim government is overthrown five months 
                   later by the dictator's former chief of police. The U.S.'s immediate recognition 
                   of the new dictator does much to tarnish Roosevelt's Good Neighbor policy in 
                   the eyes of Latin Americans. </p>
                 <p>1946 U.S. Army School of the Americas opens in Panama as a hemisphere-wide 
                   military academy. Its linchpin is the doctrine of National Security, by which 
                   the chief threat to a nation is internal subversion; this will be the guiding 
                   principle behind dictatorships in Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Chile, Central 
                   America, and elsewhere. </p>
                 <p>1948 Jos&eacute; Figueres Ferrer wins a short civil war to become President 
                   of Costa Rica. Figueres is supported by the U.S., which has informed San Jos&eacute; 
                   that its forces in the Panama Canal are ready to come to the capital to end 
                   &quot;communist control&quot; of Costa Rica. </p>
                 <p>1954 Jacobo Arbenz Guzm&aacute;n, elected president of Guatemala, introduces 
                   land reform and seizes some idle lands of United Fruit— proposing to pay for 
                   them the value United Fruit claimed on its tax returns. The CIA organizes a 
                   small force to overthrow him and begins training it in Honduras. When Arbenz 
                   naively asks for U.S. military help to meet this threat, he is refused; when 
                   he buys arms from Czechoslovakia it only proves he's a Red.</p>
                 <p>1957 Eisenhower establishes Office of Public Safety to train Latin American 
                   police forces. </p>
                 <p>1959 Fidel Castro takes power in Cuba. Several months earlier he had undertaken 
                   a triumphal tour through the U.S., which included a CIA briefing on the Red 
                   menace. </p>
                 <p>1960 Eisenhower authorizes covert actions to get rid of Castro. Among other 
                   things, the CIA tries assassinating him with exploding cigars and poisoned milkshakes. 
                   Other covert actions against Cuba include burning sugar fields, blowing up boats 
                   in Cuban harbors, and sabotaging industrial equipment. </p>
                 <p>1960 The Canal Zone becomes the focus of U.S. counterinsurgency training. </p>
                 <p>1960 A new junta in El Salvador promises free elections; Eisenhower, fearing 
                   leftist tendencies, withholds recognition. A more attractive right-wing counter-coup 
                   comes along in three months. </p>
                 <p>1960 Guatemalan officers attempt to overthrow the regime of Presidente Fuentes; 
                   Eisenhower stations warships and 2000 Marines offshore while Fuentes puts down 
                   the revolt. [Another source says that the U.S. provided air support for Fuentes.] </p>
                 <p>1960s U.S. Green Berets train Guatemalan army in counterinsurgency techniques. 
                   Guatemalan efforts against its insurgents include aerial bombing, scorched-earth 
                   assaults on towns suspected of aiding the rebels, and death squads, which killed 
                   20,000 people between 1966 and </p>
                 <p>1976. U.S. Army Col. John Webber claims that it was at his instigation that 
                   &quot;the technique of counter-terror had been implemented by the army.&quot; </p>
                 <p>1961 U.S. organizes force of 1400 anti-Castro Cubans, ships it to the Bah&iacute;a 
                   de los Cochinos. Castro's army routs it. </p>
                 <p>1961 CIA-backed coup overthrows elected Pres. J. M. Velasco Ibarra of Ecuador, 
                   who has been too friendly with Cuba. </p>
                 <p>1962 CIA engages in campaign in Brazil to keep Jo&atilde;o Goulart from achieving 
                   control of Congress. </p>
                 <p>1963 CIA-backed coup overthrows elected social democrat Juan Bosch in the Dominican 
                   Republic. </p>
                 <p>1963 A far-right-wing coup in Guatemala, apparently U.S.-supported, forestalls 
                   elections in which &quot;extreme leftist&quot; Juan Jos&eacute; Ar&eacute;valo 
                   was favored to win. </p>
                 <p>1964 The free market in Nicaragua: The Somoza family controls &quot;about one-tenth 
                   of the cultivable land in Nicaragua, and just about everything else worth owning, 
                   the country's only airline, one television station, a newspaper, a cement plant, 
                   textile mill, several sugar refineries, half-a-dozen breweries and distilleries, 
                   and a Mercedes-Benz agency.&quot; —Life World Library </p>
                 <p>1965 A coup in the Dominican Republic attempts to restore Bosch's government. 
                   The U.S. invades and occupies the country to stop this &quot;Communist rebellion,&quot; 
                   with the help of the dictators of Brazil, Paraguay, Honduras, and Nicaragua. </p>
                 <p>1966 U.S. sends arms, advisors, and Green Berets to Guatemala to implement 
                   a counterinsurgency campaign. </p>
                 <p>1967 A team of Green Berets is sent to Bolivia to help find and assassinate 
                   Che Guevara. </p>
                 <p>1968 Gen. Jos&eacute; Alberto Medrano, who is on the payroll of the CIA, organizes 
                   the ORDEN paramilitary force, considered the precursor of El Salvador's death 
                   squads. </p>
                 <p>1970 In this year (just as an example), U.S. investments in Latin America earn 
                   $1.3 billion; while new investments total $302 million. </p>
                 <p>1970 Salvador Allende Gossens elected in Chile. Suspends foreign loans, nationalizes 
                   foreign companies. For the phone system, pays ITT the company's minimized valuation 
                   for tax purposes. The CIA provides covert financial support for Allende's opponents, 
                   both during and after his election. </p>
                 <p>1972 U.S. stands by as military suspends an election in El Salvador in which 
                   centrist Jos&eacute; Napole&oacute;n Duarte was favored to win. (Compare with 
                   the emphasis placed on the 1982 elections.) </p>
                 <p> 1973 U.S.-supported military coup kills Allende and brings Augusto Pinochet 
                   Ugarte to power. Pinochet imprisons hundreds of thousands of Chileans (torture 
                   and rape are the usual methods of interrogation), terminates civil liberties, 
                   abolishes unions, extends the work week to 48 hours, and reverses Allende's 
                   land reforms. </p>
                 <p>1973 Military takes power in Uruguay, supported by U.S. The subsequent repression 
                   reportedly features the world's highest percentage of the population imprisoned 
                   for political reasons. </p>
                 <p>1974 Office of Public Safety is abolished when it is revealed that police are 
                   being taught torture techniques. </p>
                 <p>1976 Election of Jimmy Carter leads to a new emphasis on human rights in Central 
                   America. Carter cuts off aid to the Guatemalan military (or tries to; some slips 
                   through) and reduces aid to El Salvador. </p>
                 <p>1979 Ratification of the Panama Canal treaty which is to return the Canal to 
                   Panama by 1999. </p>
                 <p>1980 A right-wing junta takes over in El Salvador. U.S. begins massively supporting 
                   El Salvador, assisting the military in its fight against FMLN guerrillas. Death 
                   squads proliferate; Archbishop Romero is assassinated by right-wing terrorists; 
                   35,000 civilians are killed in 1978-81. The rape and murder of four U.S. churchwomen 
                   results in the suspension of U.S. military aid for one month. The U.S. demands 
                   that the junta undertake land reform. Within 3 years, however, the reform program 
                   is halted by the oligarchy. </p>
                 <p>1980 U.S., seeking a stable base for its actions in El Salvador and Nicaragua, 
                   tells the Honduran military to clean up its act and hold elections. The U.S. 
                   starts pouring in $100 million of aid a year and basing the contras on Honduran 
                   territory. Death squads are also active in Honduras, and the contras tend to 
                   act as a state within a state. </p>
                 <p>1981 The CIA steps in to organize the contras in Nicaragua, who started the 
                   previous year as a group of 60 ex-National Guardsmen; by 1985 there are about 
                   12,000 of them. 46 of the 48 top military leaders are ex-Guardsmen. The U.S. 
                   also sets up an economic embargo of Nicaragua and pressures the IMF and the 
                   World Bank to limit or halt loans to Nicaragua. </p>
                 <p>1981 Gen. Torrijos of Panama is killed in a plane crash. There is a suspicion 
                   of CIA involvement, due to Torrijos' friendly relations with Cuba. </p>
                 <p>1982 A coup brings Gen. Efra&iacute;n R&iacute;os Montt to power in Guatemala, 
                   and gives the Reagan administration the opportunity to increase military aid. 
                   R&iacute;os Montt's evangelical beliefs do not prevent him from accelerating 
                   the counterinsurgency campaign. </p>
                 <p>1983 Another coup in Guatemala replaces R&iacute;os Montt. The new President, 
                   Oscar Mej&iacute;a V&iacute;ctores, was trained by the U.S. and seems to have 
                   cleared his coup beforehand with U.S. authorities. </p>
                 <p>1983 U.S. troops take over tiny Granada. Rather oddly, it intervenes shortly 
                   after a coup has overthrown the previous, socialist leader. One of the justifications 
                   for the action is the building of a new airport with Cuban help, which Granada 
                   claimed was for tourism and Reagan argued was for Soviet use. Later the U.S. 
                   announces plans to finish the airport to develop tourism. </p>
                 <p>1983 Boland Amendment prohibits CIA and Defense Dept. from spending money to 
                   overthrow the government of Nicaragua— a law the Reagan administration violates. </p>
                 <p> 1984 CIA mines three Nicaraguan harbors. Nicaragua takes this action to the 
                   World Court, which brings an $18 billion judgment against the U.S. The U.S. 
                   refuses to recognize the Court's jurisdiction in the case. </p>
                 <p>1984 U.S. spends $10 million to orchestrate elections in El Salvador— something 
                   of a farce, since left-wing parties are under heavy repression, and the military 
                   has already declared that it will not answer to the elected president. </p>
                 <p>1989 U.S. invades Panama to dislodge CIA-boy-gone-wrong Manuel Noriega, an 
                   event which marks the evolution of the U.S.'s favorite excuse from Communism 
                   to drugs.</p>
