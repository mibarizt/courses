                 <h1> Judith Ortiz Cofer<br />
  &quot;The Latin Deli: An Ars Poetica&quot; (1993) </h1>
                 <p> Despite differences in customs, foods, and even political 
                   perspectives, Latinos in the United States are bound together as a community 
                   through collective roots in Europe, Africa, and the New World as well as by 
                   their experiences in America itself. One writer who has addressed the essential 
                   unity of Latinos is the Puerto Rican poet Judith Ortiz Cofer. After spending 
                   most of her childhood in New Jersey, Cofer began to write poetry and prose 
                   fiction. In &quot;The Latin Deli: An Ars Poetica&quot; (from <em>The Latin 
                     Deli</em>, 1993), the poet reminds us not only of the specific characteristics 
                   of various Latino groups in America but also of the ties that bind them. Cofer 
                   employs a local Latin Deli to demonstrate that the qualities of uniformness 
                   and uniqueness are not mutually exclusive, and that the memories of the past 
                   and hopes for the future can be intertwined on a daily basis.</p>
                 <p>&nbsp;</p>
                 <h2>&quot;The Latin Deli: An Ars Poetica&quot;</h2>
                 <p></p>
                 <p>Presiding over a formica counter,</p>
                 <p> plastic Mother and Child magnetized</p>
                 <p> to the top of an ancient register,</p>
                 <p> the heady mix of smells from the open bins</p>
                 <p> of dried codfish, the green plantains</p>
                 <p> hanging in stalks like votive offerings,</p>
                 <p> she is the Patroness of Exiles,</p>
                 <p> a woman of no-age who was never pretty,</p>
                 <p> who spends her days selling canned memories</p>
                 <p> while listening to the Puerto Ricans complain</p>
                 <p> that it would be cheaper to fly to San Juan</p>
                 <p> than to buy a pound of Bustelo coffee here,</p>
                 <p> and to Cubans perfecting their speech</p>
                 <p> of a &quot;glorious return&quot; to Havana—where no one</p>
                 <p> has been allowed to die and nothing to change until then;</p>
                 <p> to Mexicans who pass through, talking lyrically</p>
                 <p> of <em>d&oacute;lares</em> to be made in El Norte—</p>
                 <p></p>
                 <p>all wanting the comfort</p>
                 <p> of spoken Spanish, to gaze upon the family portrait</p>
                 <p> of her plain wide face, her ample bosom</p>
                 <p> resting on her plump arms, her look of maternal interest</p>
                 <p> as they speak to her and each other</p>
                 <p> of their dreams and their disillusions—</p>
                 <p> how she smiles understanding,</p>
                 <p> when they walk down the narrow aisles of her store</p>
                 <p> reading the labels of packages aloud, as if</p>
                 <p> they were the names of lost lovers; <em>Suspiros</em>,</p>
                 <p> <em>Merengues</em>, the stale candy of everyone's childhood.</p>
                 <p>&nbsp;</p>
                 <p>She spends her days</p>
                 <p> slicing <em>jam&oacute;n y queso</em> and wrapping it in wax paper</p>
                 <p> tied with string: plain ham and cheese</p>
                 <p> that would cost less at the A&amp;P, but it would not satisfy</p>
                 <p> the hunger of the fragile old man lost in the folds</p>
                 <p> of his winter coat, who brings her lists of items</p>
                 <p> that he reads to her like poetry, or the others,</p>
                 <p> whose needs she must divine, conjuring up products</p>
                 <p> from places that now exist only in their hearts—</p>
                 <p> closed ports she must trade with.</p>
