                 <h1>Richard Rodriguez (San Francisco, 1944- )<br />
                     <em>Hunger of Memory: The Education of Richard Rodriguez</em> (1982) </h1>
                 <p>Richard Rodr&iacute;guez, a high-profile chicano 
                   essayist and contributing editor to <em>Harper's</em> magazine and the Sunday 
                   edition of the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>, writes about issues of biculturalism 
                   in the United States. In his autobiographical <em>Hunger of Memory: The Education 
                     of Richard Rodriguez</em> (1982), he explores language as both the locus of cultural 
                   convergence, and the principal fundament of identity.</p>
                 <h2>Hunger of Memory: The Education 
                   of Richard Rodriguez</h2>
                 <p>During those years when I was first conscious of hearing, my 
                   mother and father addressed me only in Spanish; in Spanish I learned to reply. 
                   By contrast, English (<em>ingl&eacute;s</em>), rarely heard in the house, was 
                   the language I came to associate with <em>gringos</em>. I learned my first words 
                   of English overhearing my parents speak to strangers. At five years of age, 
                   I knew just enough English for my mother to trust me on errands to stores one 
                   block away. No more.</p>
                 <p>I was a listening child, careful to hear the very different 
                   sounds of Spanish and English. Wide-eyed with hearing, I'd listen to sounds 
                   more than words. First, there were English (<em>gringo</em>) sounds. So many words 
                   were still unknown that when the butcher or the lady at the drugstore said something 
                   to me, exotic polysyllabic sounds would bloom in the midst of their sentences. 
                   Often, the speech of people in public seemed to me very loud, booming with confidence. 
                   The man behind the counter would literally ask, 'What can I do for you?' But 
                   by being so firm and so clear, the sound of his voice said that he was a <em>gringo</em>; 
                   he belonged in public society.</p>
                 <p>I would also hear then the high nasal notes of middle-class 
                   American speech. The air stirred with sound. Sometimes, even now, when I have 
                   been traveling abroad for several weeks, I will hear what I heard as a boy. 
                   In hotel lobbies or airports, in Turkey or Brazil, some Americans will pass, 
                   and suddenly I will hear it again—the high sound of American voices. For a 
                   few seconds I will hear it with pleasure, for it is now the sound of <em>my</em> society—a reminder of home. But inevitably—already on the flight headed 
                   for home—the sound fades with repetition. I will be unable to hear it anymore.</p>
                 <p>When I was a boy, things were different. The accent of <em>los 
                   gringos</em> was never pleasing nor was it hard to hear. Crowds at Safeway or 
                   at bus stops would be noisy with sound. And I would be forced to edge away from 
                   the chirping chatter above me.</p>
                 <p>I was unable to hear my own sounds, but I knew very well that 
                   I spoke English poorly. My words could not stretch far enough to form complete 
                   thoughts. And the words I did speak I didn't know well enough to make into distinct 
                   sounds. (Listeners would usually lower their heads, better to hear what I was 
                   trying to say.) But it was one thing for <em>me</em> to speak English with difficulty. 
                   It was more troubling for me to hear my parents speak in public: their high-whining 
                   vowels and guttural consonants; their sentences that got stuck with 'eh' and 
                   'ah' sounds; the confused syntax; the hesitant rhythm of sounds so different 
                   from the way <em>gringos</em> spoke. I'd notice, moreover, that my parents' voices 
                   were softer than those of <em>gringos</em> we'd meet.</p>
                 <p>I am tempted now to say that none of this mattered. In adulthood 
                   I am embarrassed by childhood fears. And, in a way, it didn't matter very much 
                   that my parents could not speak English with ease. Their linguistic difficulties 
                   had no serious consequences. My mother and father made themselves understood 
                   at the county hospital clinic and at government offices. And yet, in another 
                   way, it mattered very much—it was unsettling to hear my parents struggle with 
                   English. Hearing them, I'd grow nervous, my clutching trust in their protection 
                   and power weakened.</p>
                 <p>There were many times like the night at a brightly lit gasoline 
                   station (a blaring white memory) when I stood uneasily, hearing my father. He 
                   was talking to a teenaged attendant. I do not recall what they were saying, 
                   but I cannot forget the sounds my father made as he spoke. At one point his 
                   words slid together to form one word—sounds as confused as the threads of 
                   blue and green oil in the puddle next to my shoes. His voice rushed through 
                   what he had left to say. And, toward the end, reached falsetto notes, appealing 
                   to his listener's understanding. I looked away to the lights of passing automobiles. 
                   I tried not to hear anymore. But I heard only too well the calm, easy tones 
                   in the attendant's reply. Shortly afterward, walking toward home with my father, 
                   I shivered when he put his hand on my shoulder. The very first chance that I 
                   got, I evaded his grasp and ran on ahead into the dark, skipping with feigned 
                   boyish exuberance.</p>
                 <p>But then there was Spanish. <em>Espa&ntilde;ol</em>: my family's 
                   language. <em>Espa&ntilde;ol</em>: the language that seemed to me a private language. 
                   I'd hear strangers on the radio and in the Mexican Catholic church across town 
                   speaking in Spanish, but I couldn't really believe that Spanish was a public 
                   language, like English. Spanish speakers, rather, seemed related to me, for 
                   I sensed that we shared—through our language—the experience of feeling apart 
                   from <em>los gringos</em>. It was thus a ghetto Spanish that I heard and I spoke. 
                   Like those whose lives are bound by a barrio, I was reminded by Spanish of my 
                   separateness from <em>los otros</em>, <em>los gringos</em> in power. But more intensely 
                   than for most barrio children—because I did not live in a barrio—Spanish 
                   seemed to me the language of home. (Most days it was only at home that I'd hear 
                   it.) It became the language of joyful return.</p>
                 <p>A family member would say something to me and I would feel myself 
                   specially recognized. My parents would say something to me and I would feel 
                   embraced by the sounds of their words. Those sounds said: <em>I am speaking with 
                     ease in Spanish. I am addressing you in words I never use with los gringos. 
                     I recognize you as someone special, close, like no one outside. You belong with 
                     us. In the family.
                     (Ricardo.)</em></p>
                 <p>At the age of five, six, well past the time when most other 
                   children no longer easily notice the difference between sounds uttered at home 
                   and words spoken in public, I had a different experience. I lived in a world 
                   magically compounded of sounds. I remained a child longer than most; I lingered 
                   too long, poised at the edge of language, often frightened by the sounds of <em>los gringos</em>, delighted by the sounds of Spanish at home. I shared with 
                   my family a language that was startlingly different from that used in the great 
                   city around us.</p>
                 <p>For me there were none of the gradations between public and 
                   private society so normal to a maturing child. Outside the house was public 
                   society; inside the house was private. Just opening or closing the screen door 
                   behind me was an important experience. I'd rarely leave home all alone or without 
                   reluctance. Walking down the sidewalk, under the canopy of tall trees, I'd warily 
                   notice the—suddenly—silent neighborhood kids who stood warily watching me. 
                   Nervously, I'd arrive at the grocery store to hear there the sounds of the <em>gringo</em>—foreign to me—reminding me that in this world so big, I was a foreigner. 
                   But then I'd return. Walking back toward our house; climbing the steps from 
                   the sidewalk, when the front door was open in summer, I'd hear voices beyond 
                   the screen door talking in Spanish. For a second or two, I'd stay, linger there, 
                   listening; Smiling, I'd hear my mother call out, saying in Spanish (words): 
                   'Is that you, Richard?' All the while her sounds would assure me: <em>You are 
                     home now; come closer; inside. With us.</em></p>
                 <p> '<em>S&iacute;</em>,' I'd reply.</p>
                 <p> Once more inside the house I would resume (assume) my place 
                   in the family. The sounds would dim, grow harder to hear. Once more at home, 
                   I would grow less aware of that fact. It required, however, no more than the 
                   blurt of the doorbell to alert me to listen to sounds all over again. The house 
                   would turn instantly still while my mother went to the door. I'd hear her hard 
                   English sounds. I'd wait to hear her voice return to soft-sounding Spanish, 
                   which assured me, as surely as did the clicking tongue of the lock on the door, 
                   that the stranger was gone.</p>
                 <p>[...]</p>
                 <p>Today I hear bilingual educators say that children lose a degree 
                   of 'individuality' by becoming assimilated into public society. (Bilingual schooling 
                   was popularized in the seventies, that decade when middle-class ethnics began 
                   to resist the process of assimilation—the American melting pot.) But the bilingualists 
                   simplistically scorn the value and necessity of assimilation. They do not seem 
                   to realize that there are <em>two</em> ways a person is individualized. So they 
                   do not realize that while one suffers a diminished sense of private individuality 
                   by becoming assimilated into public society, such assimilation makes possible 
                   the achievement of public individuality.</p>
                 <p>The bilingualists insist that a student should be reminded of 
                   his difference from others in mass society, his heritage. But they equate mere 
                   separateness with individuality. The fact is that only in private—with intimates—is separateness from the crowd a prerequisite for individuality. (An intimate 
                   draws me apart, tells me that I am unique, unlike all others.) In public, by 
                   contrast, full individuality is achieved, paradoxically, by those who are able 
                   to consider themselves members of the crowd. Thus it happened for me: Only when 
                   I was able to think of myself as an American, no longer an alien in <em>gringo</em> society, could I seek the rights and opportunities necessary for full public 
                   individuality. The social and political advantages I enjoy as a man result from 
                   the day that I came to believe that my name, indeed, is <em>Rich-heard Road-ree-guess</em>.
