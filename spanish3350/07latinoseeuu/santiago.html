                 <h1>Esmeralda Santiago<br />
                     <em>When I Was Puerto Rican</em> (1993) </h1>
                 <p>Esmeralda Santiago has been published in the <em>New York Times</em>, 
                   the <em>Boston Globe</em>, the <em>Christian Science Monitor</em>, and <em>Vista</em> magazine. The following is an excerpt from her memoir, <em>When I Was Puerto 
                     Rican</em> (1993), that  illustrates through the eyes and ears of a child the complex 
                   relationship between Puerto Ricans and the United States.</p>
                 <p>&nbsp;</p>
                 <h2>When I Was Puerto Rican</h2>
                 <p>&quot;Today,&quot; Miss Jim&eacute;nez said, &quot;you will 
                   be vaccinated by the school nurse.&quot;</p>
                 <p> There had never been a school nurse at Mac&uacute;n Elementary School, but lately 
                   a woman dressed in white, with a tall, stiff cap atop her short cropped hair, 
                   had set up an infirmary in a corner of the lunchroom. Forms had been sent home, 
                   and Mami had told me and Delsa that we would be receiving polio vaccines.</p>
                 <p>&quot;What's polio?&quot; I asked, imagining another parasite in my belly.</p>
                 <p>&quot;It's a very bad disease that makes you crippled,&quot; she said.</p>
                 <p>&quot;Is it like meningitis?&quot; Delsa asked. A brother of one of her friends 
                   had that disease; his arms and hands were twisted into his body, his legs splayed 
                   out at the knees, so that he walked as if he were about to kneel.</p>
                 <p>&quot;No,&quot; Mami said, &quot;it's worse. If you get polio, you die, or you 
                   spend the rest of your life in a wheelchair or inside an iron lung.&quot;</p>
                 <p>&quot;An iron lung!?!?&quot; It was impossible. There could not be such a thing.</p>
                 <p>&quot;It's not like a real lung, silly,&quot; Mami laughed. &quot;It's a machine 
                   that breathes for you.&quot;</p>
                 <p>&quot;<em>&iexcl;Ay Dios m&iacute;o!</em>&quot; Polio was worse than <em>solitaria</em>.</p>
                 <p>&quot;But how can it do that?&quot; Delsa's eyes opened and shut as if she were 
                   testing to see whether she was asleep or awake.</p>
                 <p>&quot;I don't know how it works,&quot; Mami said. &quot;Ask your father.&quot;</p>
                 <p> Delsa and I puzzled over how you could have an iron lung, and that night, when 
                   Papi came home from work; we made him draw one for us and show us how a machine 
                   could do what people couldn't. He drew a long tube and at one end made a stick 
                   figure face.</p>
                 <p>&quot;It looks like a can,&quot; Delsa said, and Papi laughed.</p>
                 <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; he said, &quot;it does. Just like a can.&quot;</p>
                 <p> Miss Jim&eacute;nez sent us out to see the nurse two at a time; in alphabetical 
                   order. By the time she got to the S's, I was shaky, because every one of the 
                   children who had gone before me had come back crying, pressing a wad of cotton 
                   against their arm. Ignacio Sep&uacute;lveda walked next to me, and even though 
                   he was as scared as I was, he pretended he wasn't.</p>
                 <p>&quot;What crybabies!&quot; he said. &quot;I've had shots before and they don't 
                   hurt that much.&quot;</p>
                 <p>&quot;When?&quot;</p>
                 <p>&quot;Last year. They gave us shots for tuberculosis.&quot; We were nearing 
                   the lunchroom, and Ignacio slowed down, tagged on my arm, and whispered, &quot;It's 
                   all because of politics.&quot;</p>
                 <p>&quot;What are you talking about? Politics isn't a disease like polio. It's 
                   something men talk about at the bus stop.&quot; I'd heard Papi tell Mami when 
                   he was late that he'd missed the bus because he'd been discussing politics.</p>
                 <p> Ignacio kept his voice to a whisper, as if he were telling me something no one 
                   else knew. &quot;My Papa says the government's doing all this stuff for us because 
                   it's an election year.&quot;</p>
                 <p>&quot;What does that have to do with it?&quot;</p>
                 <p>&quot;They give kids shots and free breakfast, stuff like that, so that our 
                   dads will vote for them.&quot;</p>
                 <p>&quot;So?&quot;</p>
                 <p>&quot;Don't you know anything?&quot;</p>
                 <p>&quot;I know a lot of things.&quot;</p>
                 <p>&quot;You don't know anything about politics.&quot;</p>
                 <p>&quot; Do so.&quot;</p>
                 <p>&quot;Do not.&quot;</p>
                 <p> &quot;Do so.&quot;</p>
                 <p>&quot;Who's the governor of Puerto Rico, then?&quot;</p>
                 <p>&quot;Oh, you could have asked something really hard! . . . Everyone knows it's 
                   Don Luis Mu&ntilde;oz Mar&iacute;n.&quot;</p>
                 <p>&quot;Yeah, well, who's <em>el presidente</em> of the Jun-ited Estates?&quot;</p>
                 <p>&quot;Ay-sen-hou-err.&quot;</p>
                 <p>&quot;I bet you don't know his first name.&quot;</p>
                 <p> I knew then I had him. I scanned Papi's newspaper daily, and I had seen pictures 
                   of <em>el presidente</em> on the golf course, and of his wife's funny hairdo.</p>
                 <p>&quot;His first name is Eekeh,&quot; I said, puffed with knowledge. &quot;And 
                   his wife's name is Mami.&quot;</p>
                 <p>&quot;Well, he's an imperialist, just like all the other gringos!&quot; Ignacio 
                   said, and I was speechless because Mami and Papi never let us say things like 
                   that about grown ups, even if they were true.</p>
                 <p> When we came into the lunchroom, Ignacio presented his arm to the nurse as if 
                   instead of a shot he were getting a medal. He winced as the nurse stuck the 
                   needle into him and blinked a few times to push back tears. But he didn't cry, 
                   and I didn't either, though I wanted to. There was no way I'd have Ignacio Sep&uacute;lveda 
                   calling me a crybaby.</p>
                 <p>***</p>
                 <p>&quot;Papi, what's an imperialist?&quot;</p>
                 <p> He stopped the hammer in midstrike and looked at me. &quot;Where did you hear 
                   that word?&quot;</p>
                 <p>&quot;Ignacio Sep&uacute;lveda said Eekeh Aysenhouerr is an imperialist. He 
                   said all gringos are.&quot;</p>
                 <p> Papi looked around as if someone were hiding behind a bush and listening in. &quot;I don't want you repeating those words to anybody. . .&quot;</p>
                 <p>&quot;I know that, Papi . . . . I just want to know what it means. Are gringos 
                   the same as <em>americanos</em>?&quot;</p>
                 <p>&quot;You should never call an <em>americano</em> a gringo. It's a very bad insult.&quot;</p>
                 <p>&quot;But why?&quot;</p>
                 <p>&quot;It just is.&quot; It wasn't like Papi not to give a real answer to my 
                   questions. &quot;Besides, <em>el presidente</em>'s name is pronounced Ayk, not 
                   Eekeh.&quot; He went back to his hammering.</p>
                 <p> I handed him a nail from the can at his feet. &quot;How come it's a bad insult?&quot;</p>
                 <p> He stopped banging the wall and looked at me. I stared back, and he put his 
                   hammer down, took off his hat, brushed his hand across his forehead, wiped it 
                   on his pants, sat on the stoop, and leaned his elbows back, stretching his legs 
                   out in front of him. This was the response I expected. Now I would hear all 
                   about gringos and imperialists.</p>
                 <p>&quot;Puerto Rico was a colony of Spain after Columbus landed here,&quot; he 
                   began, like a schoolteacher.</p>
                 <p>&quot;I know that.&quot;</p>
                 <p> &quot;Don't interrupt..&quot;</p>
                 <p> &quot;Sorry&quot;</p>
                 <p>&quot;In 1898, los <em>Estados Unidos</em> invaded Puerto Rico, and we became 
                   their colony. A lot of Puerto Ricans don't think that's right. They call <em>americanos</em> imperialists, which means they want to change our country and our culture to 
                   be like theirs.&quot;</p>
                 <p> &quot;Is that why they teach us English in school, so we can speak like them?&quot;</p>
                 <p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
                 <p> &quot;Well, I'm not going to learn English so I don't become American.&quot; .</p>
                 <p> He chuckled. &quot;Being American is not just a language, <em>negrita</em>, it's 
                   a lot of other things.&quot;</p>
                 <p>&quot;Like what?&quot;</p>
                 <p> He scratched his head. &quot;Like the food you eat . . . the music you listen 
                   to . . . the things you believe in.&quot;</p>
                 <p>&quot;Do they believe in God?&quot;</p>
                 <p>&quot;Some of them do.&quot;</p>
                 <p> &quot;Do they believe in phantasms and witches?&quot;</p>
                 <p>&quot;Yes, some Americans believe in that.&quot;</p>
                 <p> &quot;Mami doesn't believe any of that stuff.&quot;</p>
                 <p>&quot;I know. I don't either.&quot;</p>
                 <p>&quot;Why not?&quot; .</p>
                 <p>&quot;I just . . . I believe in things I can see.&quot;</p>
                 <p>&quot;Why do people call <em>americanos</em> gringos?&quot;</p>
                 <p>&quot;We call them gringos, they call us spiks.&quot;</p>
                 <p> &quot;What does that mean?&quot;</p>
                 <p> &quot;Well,&quot; he sat up, leaned his elbows on his knees and looked at the 
                   ground, as if he were embarrassed. &quot;There are many Puerto Ricans in New 
                   York, and when someone asks them a question they say, 'I don spik inglish' instead 
                   of 'I don't speak English.' They make fun of our accent.&quot;</p>
                 <p> &quot;<em>Americanos</em> talk funny when they speak Spanish.&quot;</p>
                 <p>&quot;Yes, they do. The ones who don't take the trouble to learn it well.&quot; 
                   He pushed his hat back, and the sun burned into his already brown face, making 
                   him squint. &quot;That's part of being an imperialist. They expect us to do 
                   things their way, even in our country.&quot;</p>
                 <p>&quot;That's not fair.&quot;</p>
                 <p>&quot;No, it isn't.&quot; He stood up and picked up his hammer. &quot;Well, 
                   I'd better get back to work, <em>negrita</em>. Do you want to help?&quot;</p>
                 <p>&quot;Okay.&quot; I followed him, holding the can of nails up so he wouldn't 
                   have to bend over to pick them up. &quot;Papi?&quot;</p>
                 <p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
                 <p>&quot;If we eat all that American food they give us at the <em>centro comunal</em>, 
                   will we become <em>americanos</em>?&quot;</p>
                 <p> He banged a nail hard into the wall, then turned to me and, with a broad smile 
                   on his face, said, &quot;Only if you like it better than our Puerto Rican food.&quot;</p>
