                 <h1>&quot;Latino America&quot;<br />
                     <em>Newsweek</em>,
                   July 12, 1999, p. 48.<br />
                   by  Brook Larmerrt</h1>
                 <p>Strolling along northwest eighth Street in Miami—a.k.a. Calle 
                   Ocho—is like taking a trip through another country. But last week the sights 
                   and sounds of Calle Ocho were both intensely foreign and undeniably American. 
                   A crowd of angry Cuban exiles marched down the street denouncing the U.S. Coast 
                   Guard's use of force to round up six Cuban refugees near a local beach the day 
                   before. From the sidelines, other Latinos looked on: prim Honduran clerks at 
                   an evangelical bookstore, spiffed-up businessmen at an Argentine steakhouse, 
                   sweaty construction workers eating Salvadoran pupusas. Merengue music blasted 
                   indifferently from the Do-Re-Mi music shop. But the elderly Cubans playing dominoes 
                   in Maximo Gomez Park stood and joined in with the protesters: &quot;Libertad! 
                   Libertad!&quot;</p>
                 <p>Could this be the face of America's future? Better believe it. 
                   No place in the United States is quite so international as Miami; even the Latinos 
                   who run the city joke that they like it &quot;because it's so close to America.&quot; 
                   But Miami, like New York and Los Angeles, is ground zero for a demographic upheaval 
                   that is unfolding across America. Like the arrival of European immigrants at 
                   the turn of the century, the tide of Hispanic immigrants—and the fast growth 
                   of Latino families—has injected a new energy into the nation's cities.</p>
                 <p>Latinos are changing the way the country looks, feels and thinks, 
                   eats, dances and votes. From teeming immigrant meccas to small-town America, 
                   they are filling churches, building businesses and celebrating their Latin heritage. 
                   In a special NEWSWEEK Poll of Latinos, 83 percent said being Hispanic was important 
                   to their identity. They are overwhelmingly Roman Catholic; 42 percent go to 
                   church once a week. They've become a potent, increasingly unpredictable political 
                   force: 37 percent of 18- to 34-year-old Latinos say they are independent, about 
                   twice as many as their Hispanic elders. In America, a country that constantly 
                   redefines itself, the rise of Latinos also raises questions about race, identity 
                   and culture—and whether the United States will ever truly be one nation.</p>
                 <p>The numbers couldn't be clearer. Fueled by massive (and mostly 
                   legal) immigration and high birthrates, the Latino population has grown 38 percent 
                   since 1990—to 31 million—while the overall population has grown just 9 percent. 
                   And with more than a third of the Latino population still under 18, the boom 
                   is just beginning. By the year 2005, Latinos are projected to be the largest 
                   minority in the country, passing non-Hispanic blacks for the first time. By 
                   2050, nearly one quarter of the population will be Latino. &quot;The [African-American] 
                   civil-rights slogan was 'We shall overcome',&quot; says Christy Haubegger, the 
                   30-year-old founding editor of the bilingual magazine Latina. &quot;Ours is 
                   going to be 'We shall overwhelm'.&quot;</p>
                 <p>They may just have the muscle to back that up—particularly 
                   in politics. Though they accounted for only 6 percent of those who voted in 
                   the 1998 midterm elections, Hispanics are clustered in 11 key states, with a 
                   total of 217 out of the 270 Electoral College votes needed for the presidency. 
                   And neither party has a lock on this new force. &quot;Latinos are the soccer 
                   moms of the year 2000,&quot; says Gregory Rodriguez of the New America Foundation. 
                   Is it any wonder that Al Gore and George W. Bush were both on campaign stops 
                   in Florida and California last week, eagerly greeting voters in Spanish?</p>
                 <p>The driving force behind the Latino wave are members of a cohort 
                   that is sometimes called Generation N; [por las proyecciones demogr&aacute;ficas]. 
                   These young Hispanics—the Latin Gen X—are influential not simply because of 
                   their huge numbers. They are making their mark—and making all things Latin 
                   suddenly seem cool. Jose Canseco, a 35-year-old Cuban-American, and Dominican-born 
                   Sammy Sosa, 30, lead the great American home-run derby. Ricky Martin, 27, and 
                   Jennifer Lopez, 28, top the pop-music charts. Actors Benjamin Bratt, 35, and 
                   Salma Hayek, 30, are quickening the national pulse.</p>
                 <p>Is the rest of America ready? Hip Anglos on both coasts are 
                   dancing salsa, learning Spanish and dabbling in Nuevo Latino cuisine. And every 
                   fifth grader seems to know the lyrics of &quot;Livin' La Vida Loca.&quot; But 
                   many Latinos doubt whether America can easily move past the stereotypes that 
                   depict them as illegals, gangbangers or entertainers. &quot;Don't try to understand 
                   Latinos through [Ricky Martin],&quot; says Manuel Magana, 21, a University of 
                   Michigan senior. &quot;It's like trying to figure out Americans by listening 
                   to the Backstreet Boys.&quot;</p>
                 <p>Latinos can't be neatly pigeonholed. They come from 22 different 
                   countries of origin, including every hybrid possible. Many are white, some are 
                   black, but most are somewhere in between. Some Latino families have been in 
                   the United States for centuries, since the days when much of the Southwest was 
                   still a part of Mexico. Others, like the six Cuban refugees, swam ashore last 
                   week. (The Coast Guard freed them a day later.) Many Latinos are assimilating 
                   into cycles of urban blight; 40 percent of Latino children now live in poverty, 
                   the highest rate ever. But millions of Hispanics are also moving into the middle 
                   class, speaking English, inter-marrying and spending cash—lots of it. U.S. 
                   Latinos pump $300 billion a year into the economy.</p>
                 <p>Not everybody has been eager to give Latinos a big abrazo. When 
                   California voters passed propositions limiting immigrant rights and Washington 
                   tightened federal immigration policy in the mid-1990s, Latinos took it as a 
                   call to arms. The best weapons of defense were citizenship and the vote. Between 
                   1994 and 1998, Latino voting in nationwide midterm elections jumped 27 percent 
                   even as overall voter turnout dropped 13 percent. The 2000 presidential election 
                   may show even more dramatic increases: Latino leaders aim to register an additional 
                   3 million voters by then.</p>
                 <p>Latinos have long leaned Democratic (Clinton got 72 percent), 
                   but their vote is alluring these days precisely because it is up for grabs—and 
                   Generation N; seems intent on keeping it that way. Gore edged out Bush among 
                   all Latinos polled, 29 percent to 28 percent, but Generation N; voters favored 
                   Bush by a margin of 9 percent. Nobody understands how Latinos can swing an election 
                   more than Nevada Sen. Harry Reid, a Democrat. During his tight 1998 race, Reid's 
                   friend, boxing promoter Bob Arum, persuaded Oscar De La Hoya to join the campaign. 
                   The charismatic boxer did two fund-raisers, a public rally and several Spanish 
                   media spots. &quot;He's the reason I'm in the Senate now,&quot; says Reid. Don't 
                   believe him? The senator won by just 428 votes.</p>
                 <p>Latinos are flattered to be considered hot commodities, whether 
                   as voters, consumers, employees or entertainers. But their aspirations, and 
                   their importance to American society, run much deeper than mere social acceptance. 
                   They are not &quot;crossing over&quot; into mainstream America; they are already 
                   here, getting more influential by the day, so the rest of America must learn 
                   to adapt as well. &quot;Something tremendous is happening,&quot; says 30-year-old 
                   novelist Ixta Maya Murray. &quot;This generation of Latinos is going to change 
                   the way America looks at itself.&quot; On the last Independence Day of the millennium, 
                   a new nation is being born.</p>
