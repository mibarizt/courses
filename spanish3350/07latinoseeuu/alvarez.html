                 <h1>Julia Alvarez</h1>
                 <p>Julia &Aacute;lvarez was born in the Dominican Republic and came 
                   to the United States when she was ten years old. In this short excerpt from her 
                   acclaimed novel <em>How the Garcia Girls Lost Their Accents</em> (1991), she captures 
                   perfectly the fear and the wonder of a young immigrant girl from the Dominican 
                   Republic who has never seen snow before.<br />
                 </p>
                 <h2>&quot;Snow&quot;, from <em>How the Garc&iacute;a Girls Lost Their Accents</em> (1991) </h2>
                 <p>Our first year in New York we rented a small apartment with 
                   a Catholic school nearby, taught by the Sisters of Charity, hefty women in long 
                   black gowns and bonnets that made them look peculiar, like dolls in mourning. 
                   I liked them a lot, especially my grandmotherly fourth grade teacher, Sister 
                   Zoe. I had a lovely name, she said, and she had me teach the whole class how 
                   to pronounce it. <em>Yo-lan-da</em>. As the only immigrant in my class, I was 
                   put in a special seat in the first row by the window, apart from the other children 
                   so that Sister Zoe could tutor me without disturbing them. Slowly, she enunciated 
                   the new words I was to repeat: <em>laundromat, cornflakes, subway, snow</em>.</p>
                 <p>Soon I picked up enough English to understand holocaust was 
                   in the air. Sister Zoe explained to a wide eyed classroom what was happening 
                   in Cuba. Russian missiles were being assembled, trained supposedly on New York 
                   City. President Kennedy, looking worried too, was on the television at home, 
                   explaining we might have to go to war against the Communists. At school, we 
                   had air raid drills: an ominous bell would go off and we'd file into the hall, 
                   fall to the floor, cover our heads with our coats, and imagine our hair falling 
                   out, the bones in our arms going soft. At home, Mami and my sisters and I said 
                   a rosary for world peace. I heard new vocabulary: <em>nuclear bomb, radioactive 
                     fallout, bomb shelter.</em> Sister Zoe explained how it would happen. She drew 
                   a picture of a mushroom on the blackboard and dotted a flurry of chalk marks 
                   for the dusty fallout that would kill us all.</p>
                 <p>The months grew cold, November, December. It was dark when I 
                   got up in the morning, frosty when I followed my breath to school. One morning 
                   as I sat at my desk daydreaming out the window, I saw dots in the air like the 
                   ones Sister Zoe had drawn random at first, then lots and lots. I shrieked, &quot;Bomb! 
                   Bomb!&quot; Sister Zoe jerked around, her full black skirt ballooning as she 
                   hurried to my side. A few girls began to cry.</p>
                 <p>But then Sister Zoe's shocked look faded. &quot;Why, Yolanda 
                   dear, that's snow!&quot; She laughed. &quot;Snow.&quot;</p>
                 <p>&quot;Snow,&quot; I repeated. I looked out the window warily. 
                   All my life I had heard about the white crystals that fell out of American skies 
                   in the winter. From my desk I watched the fine powder dust the sidewalk and 
                   parked cars below. Each flake was different, Sister Zoe had said, like a person, 
                   irreplaceable and beautiful.</p>
