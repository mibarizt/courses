                 <h1>&quot;A Whole New World&quot;<br />
                     <em>Time</em>, June 11, 2001<br />
                   by Nancy Gibbs</h1>
                 <p> Some places the border is a muddy river, too thin to plow, 
                   too thick to drink. Other places it's just a line in the sand. Over the years 
                   mapmakers redrew it, wars moved it, nature yanked it all around as the course 
                   of the Rio Grande shifted. But what would it take to make it disappear altogether? 
                   If today is like any other day, this is what is going to come across the line 
                   from Mexico: a million barrels of crude oil, 432 tons of bell peppers, 238,000 
                   light bulbs, 166 Volkswagen Beetles, 16,250 toasters, $51 million worth of auto 
                   parts, everything from the little plastic knob on the air conditioner to your 
                   cell-phone charger. It all comes in trucks and boxcars and little panel vans, 
                   and that's just the stuff that Customs can keep track of. There is also the 
                   vast shadow market, not just the cocaine and heroin and freshly laundered money, 
                   but cut-price Claritin and steroids and banned bug killers and boots made from 
                   the flippers of endangered sea turtles. </p>
                 <p> And then there are the people, more than 800,000 crisscrossing 
                   legally every day, some walking, more driving, not to mention the 4,600 or so 
                   who hop the fence and get caught a few minutes or hours later. The ones who 
                   make it are on their way to jobs as meat-packers in Iowa and carpetmakers in 
                   Georgia and gardeners in Pennsylvania. They want to come here so badly, they 
                   will risk the scorpions and the rattlesnakes, the surveillance cameras and underground 
                   sensors; they will fold into hidden compartments in the dashboard of a car or 
                   in the belly of a tanker truck. They know they can get a job no one else wants, 
                   save some money, send some home, maybe find a way to bring their families-because 
                   someday, this border may not look anything like what it does now: a barbed-wire 
                   paradox, half pried open, half bolted closed.</p>
                 <p> So how much has to cross a border before it might as well not 
                   be there at all? There is no Customs station for customs-for ideas and tastes, 
                   stories and songs, values, instincts, attitudes, and none of that stops in El 
                   Paso or San Diego anymore. The Old World fades away-salsa is more popular than 
                   ketchup; Salma Hayek is bigger than Madonna-and the border is everywhere. One 
                   day soon it may seem a little backward not to speak some Spanish, even the hybrid 
                   Spanglish of the Southwest: &quot;Como se llama your dog?&quot; Signs appear 
                   in the store windows in Garden City, Kans., that say, se habla espa&ntilde;ol, 
                   and you can buy extremely fresh mangoes at bodegas all over that town. Dalton, 
                   Ga. (pop. 27,900), has three Spanish-language newspapers. Says longtime resident 
                   Edwin Mitchell, 77: &quot;We're a border community-1,000 miles away from the 
                   border.&quot; Already, we are living in a whole new world. </p>
                 <p> Sometime in the next few years, Mexico will pass Canada as 
                   America's top trading partner. Hispanics have overtaken African Americans as 
                   the country's largest minority, the swing vote to woo, the sleeping giant to 
                   waken. If Presidents George W. Bush and Vicente Fox manage to solve the problems 
                   of two countries that need each other but don't completely trust each other, 
                   the American Century could give way to the Century of the Americas, and the 
                   border might as well have disappeared altogether.</p>
                 <p> America's 4,000-mile border with Canada is basically defended 
                   by a couple of fire trucks, and most Americans think that's about all we need. 
                   The southern border is half as long, has the equivalent of an army division 
                   patrolling it, and many Americans say it should be buttoned down even tighter. 
                   At the beginning of a new century, there may be no country on earth with as 
                   much potential as Mexico to destabilize the U.S.-and to preserve its standard 
                   of living. No wonder people can't decide how much the border should be a barrier, 
                   how much a bridge.</p>
                 <p> From the moment you set foot in the boomtowns of the Rio Grande 
                   Valley, you sense you are watching the gold rush, headlong and free spirited 
                   and corrupt and ingenious. Stand on a corner some morning in Laredo, and watch 
                   the first of 8,000 trucks a day hauling the global economy north and south, 
                   18-wheelers full of bulldozer claws and baby cribs, all passing through a town 
                   that once didn't bother to pave the streets. Now it can't pour concrete fast 
                   enough. The banks are open 7 to 7, seven days a week; the pager shops are everywhere. 
                   Every road is being widened, the road shoulders littered with pieces of blown-out 
                   tires.</p>
                 <p> Locals say you are not really a borderlander until your windshield 
                   has been broken at least once, from all the rocks flying out from under the 
                   big rigs. Much of the border is still desperately poor-McAllen, Texas, at the 
                   heart of the fourth fastest growing metro area in the U.S., is America's poorest 
                   city, the Commerce Department announced last month, with average per-capita 
                   income of $13,339 a year. But people on both sides are helping one another do 
                   the deals, cut the corners, take a region that was forever left behind and turn 
                   it into the New Frontier. The nafta prospectors saw in the opening of the border 
                   a chance to make a killing, take factories that would otherwise head to Malaysia 
                   and plunk them down right across the border, where the average Mexican worker 
                   earns slightly more in a day than an American makes in an hour, and where the 
                   highways run all the way to Canada.</p>
                 <p> That means that both countries are growing more dependent on 
                   this relationship every day. Mexicans all across the interior follow the North 
                   Star, chasing the jobs. There are now four or five cities the size of Cleveland 
                   sitting right next door, and 25 years from now as much as 40% of the entire 
                   Mexican population may be living on
                   the border. The region is Mexico's economic engine, a huge commercial classroom 
                   where the unskilled workers who were making gauze eye patches in 1980 now make 
                   atms and modems and the most popular Sony color TV sold in the U.S. </p>
                 <p> As for the U.S., we import not just the gizmos and gadgets 
                   but also a way of life, thanks to a shadow labor force that lets us eat out 
                   once a week because restaurants can hire dishwashers for sub-minimum wage. We 
                   depend on the maids and gardeners and carpenters and home-health-care workers 
                   whose children will probably become teachers and technicians and surgeons and 
                   Senators. If they all put down their tools tomorrow, we wouldn't be arguing 
                   about whether we are in a recession. </p>
                 <p> It's often said that the border is its own country, &quot;amexica,&quot; 
                   neither Mexican nor American. &quot;The border is not where the U.S. stops and 
                   Mexico begins,&quot; says Laredo mayor Betty Flores. &quot;It's where the U.S. 
                   blends into Mexico.&quot; Both sides regard their sovereign governments as distant 
                   and dysfunctional. They are proud of their ability to take care of themselves, 
                   solve their problems faster and cheaper than any faraway bureaucrat. The Brownsville 
                   fire trucks answer sirens on the other side; in Tijuana, health clinics send 
                   shuttle buses every morning to meet people coming over for everything from dentistry 
                   to dialysis. The school district in Mission, Texas, among the state's poorest, 
                   sends its old furniture over the border to help Mexican schools that are lucky 
                   to have roofs, much less desks and chairs. El Paso is redesigning the kilns 
                   of Juarez brickmakers to cut the soot from burning old tires; the twin cities 
                   have signed more treaties than their national governments can keep track of, 
                   much less ratify. &quot;The only way the cities in this region can make it,&quot; 
                   says Juarez mayor Gustavo Elizondo, &quot;is to forget that a line and a river 
                   exist here.&quot;</p>
                 <p> And yet for all the frontier pioneer spirit, local leaders 
                   do draw a line: Why should the whole country benefit from the blessings of free 
                   trade, if the border region pays the price? It costs border counties $108 million 
                   a year in law enforcement and medical expenses associated with illegal crossings, 
                   money most of these poor counties can't afford, to enforce immigration policies 
                   over which they have no control. Yes, there is a shortage of truck drivers, 
                   but there is also a shortage of judges to hear all the drug and smuggling cases. 
                   Arizona ambulance companies face bankruptcy because of all the unreimbursed 
                   costs of rescuing illegals from the desert. Schools everywhere down here are 
                   poor, overcrowded and growing. Truck traffic is good for your business but bad 
                   for your health; many border cities routinely fail to meet federal air quality 
                   standards. Border agents get sick from standing on the bridges and inhaling 
                   diesel exhaust all day. </p>
                 <p> Good health care has always been scarce here, but the border 
                   boom makes it worse: a third of all tuberculosis cases in the U.S. are concentrated 
                   in the four border states. Among the hospitals in El Paso, 50% of the patients 
                   are on some kind of public assistance, mainly Medicaid. Just about the only 
                   patients paying full freight, up front, are rich Mexicans who cross over to 
                   see a specialist. &quot;Border towns have a double burden of disease,&quot; 
                   says Russell Bennett, chief of the U.S.-Mexico Border Health Commission: &quot;those 
                   of emerging nations, like diarrhea, as well as [First World] diseases like stress 
                   and diabetes.&quot;</p>
                 <p> The poor on both sides are united by a struggle just to survive 
                   what most Americans can barely imagine. In the rural El Paso outpost of Revoluci&oacute;n, 
                   mothers cross into Juarez to buy methyl parathion, a pesticide so lethal it 
                   is banned in the U.S.; they sprinkle it around their shanties, and it kills 
                   the roaches and tarantulas for a year. But their children play in that dust 
                   and dirt, and when they get sick, their parents take them to Juarez doctors, 
                   who are cheaper and stay open into the night. If the children die, they are 
                   buried across the border; it costs about $150, instead of the $2,000 for an 
                   American grave. </p>
                 <p> Local officials are forever pestering the feds for help: If 
                   you don't build another bridge and put more Customs people on the ones we have, 
                   how can we solve our pollution problem, with 15-year-old cars idling in lines 
                   that stretch for miles? How can you order us to educate any child who appears 
                   on our school doorstep but not
                   give us the money to do it? Where are we going to find enough water? The congressional 
                   Hispanic caucus wants $1 billion in spending on roads and bridges and Customs 
                   officers; El Paso state senator Eliot Shapleigh and other Texas lawmakers have 
                   called for a Marshall Plan for the border; El Paso Congressman Sylvestre Reyes 
                   wants Bush to appoint a border czar who could cut through the red tape and make 
                   things happen. </p>
                 <p> For the first time in years, maybe ever, both the U.S. and 
                   Mexico have leaders who understand this region, know that in some ways their 
                   hemisphere's economic future may depend on whether they can fix what is broken 
                   here. Bush met with Fox three times in his first 100 days, blowing away the 
                   old once-a-year tradition. Fox dreams of a day when the border is open, and 
                   his countrymen no longer flee to survive. As Fox told Ernesto Ruffo, his top 
                   aide on the region, &quot;Put holes in the border.&quot;</p>
                 <p>But that's not going to happen until Mexico goes straight, cleans 
                   up its justice and banking systems. Even some American borderlanders who cheer 
                   integration in public go off the record to talk about what's wrong, admit that 
                   they rarely visit the other side or whisper quietly that they haven't felt the 
                   same about the place since a friend's car was hijacked a few years ago, and 
                   they never saw him again. You can sense the same mysterious half silence no 
                   matter where you go; Mexicans call it Article No. 20, as in, which of the $20 
                   is for me? Police and Customs people pay for their government jobs so they can 
                   get in on the mordida, the payoff system. Midwives in Brownsville, Texas, sold 
                   thousands of birth certificates to be used as proof of U.S. citizenship. The 
                   Arellano F&eacute;lix brothers, the Tijuana drug kingpins known for torturing, 
                   carving up and roasting their rivals, are paying $4 million a month in bribes 
                   in Baja California alone, just as the cost of doing business. The $4 million 
                   reward for their capture is one of the highest the U.S. has ever offered, and 
                   something of a bad joke under the circumstances. There hasn't been a single 
                   nibble in four years. What good is the money if you're dead?</p>
                 <p> And as lucrative as the drug-smuggling business is, the people-smuggling 
                   cartels are prospering as well. The more the U.S. cracks down on illegal immigration, 
                   the more expensive crossing becomes. The border patrol has a mission impossible: 
                   no matter how many surveillance cameras and motion detectors it installs, still 
                   the immigrants come. It's harder to cross and easier to die trying. In some 
                   ways it's the lucky ones, say the border agents, who get caught. &quot;Everything 
                   out here will either bite you, burn you or arrest you,&quot; says the Rev. Robin 
                   Hoover, of the First Christian Church in Tucson, Ariz. The Mexican government 
                   is considering handing out survival kits, complete with snake-bite antidotes 
                   and rehydration tablets, for people intending to set out across the desert-a 
                   plan U.S. officials think amounts to an official blessing for breaking American 
                   law. </p>
                 <p> Up and down the border, everyone skirts the fence in his own 
                   way. A professor in south Texas says he pays someone $50 a month to smuggle 
                   his mom over in a boat for Sunday dinners. He doesn't worry, though, because 
                   a federal agent down the street does the same for his housekeeper. &quot;Trying 
                   to stop this migration is like trying to stop a wave with a Dixie cup,&quot; 
                   says Raul Berrios, whose wife Karen runs the popular Renaissance Cafe in Bisbee, 
                   Ariz. &quot;It's going to be impossible.&quot; There is a whisper network in 
                   Bisbee, of codes and messages telling weary crossers where they can stay, safely 
                   hidden from the border patrol. </p>
                 <p> Sometimes nature lends a hand. Highway 4 through Brownsville 
                   ends with a stop sign that needs to be taken seriously. The asphalt turns into 
                   beach and leads straight into the sea. But turn right, and you can drive down 
                   the beach like the old days at Daytona, on fine, hard-packed sand, hugging the 
                   Gulf of Mexico. It's a place to appreciate a pristine view: no condos, no concession 
                   stands, no concessions at all to anything except the fact that the border begins 
                   where the Rio Grande pours into the sea, and so it has to be guarded carefully.</p>
                 <p> For the first time in 500 years, the river is so low that it 
                   just dries up altogether about 50 ft. from its destination and turns into a 
                   salt flat. Two alien weeds, hydrilla and hyacinth-border officials don't know 
                   how they got there-are growing so fast they have blocked the flow of the river. 
                   Fighting them would require approval from both sides, which is practically impossible 
                   to get. And so here, all that is left of the border are four metal stakes in 
                   the sand, tied with orange ribbons whipping in the gulf breeze.The border patrol 
                   has had to make a little sand berm to keep the smugglers from just driving across. 
                   The Mexicans, in their window-darkened Pontiacs, drive right up to the very 
                   sticks themselves, and the border patrolmen in their Suburbans get out their 
                   binoculars, look across the beach and wait to be relieved at midnight. </p>
                 <p> Just at the moment when, all up and down the river, cities 
                   are arguing about where and whether to build more bridges, haggling over diplomatic 
                   papers and environmental clearances and political payoffs, all in order to build 
                   another truck bridge over a creek-here, nature just went ahead and did it, all 
                   on its own.</p>
