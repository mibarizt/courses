                 <h1>Sandra Cisneros</h1>
                 <p>Sandra Cisneros  grew up in Chicago and currently resides in San 
                   Antonio. The following excerpts from <em>The House on Mango Street</em>, 
                   a book of childhood vignettes, are intensely evocative portraits of family life 
                   in the city: of a loving, hardworking father; the duties of the oldest child; 
                   and a young woman who dreams of the university rather than the &quot;factory&quot; 
                   and the &quot;rolling pin.&quot; Cisneros excels at capturing the small moments 
                   of tenderness and sadness in family relationships.</p>
                 <p>&nbsp;</p>
                 <h2>&quot;Papa Who Wakes Up Tired in the Dark&quot;, from <em>The House on Mango Street</em></h2>
                 <p>Your <em>abuelito</em> is dead, Papa says early one morning in 
                   my room. <em>Est&aacute; muerto</em>, and then, as if he just heard the news himself, 
                   crumples like a coat and cries, my brave Papa cries. I have never seen my Papa 
                   cry and don't know what to do.</p>
                 <p>I know he will have to go away, that he will take a plane to 
                   Mexico, all the uncles and aunts will be there, and they will have a black and 
                   white photo taken in front of the tomb with flowers shaped like spears in a 
                   white vase because this is how they send the dead away in that country.</p>
                 <p>Because I am the oldest, my father has told me first, and now 
                   it is my turn to tell the others. I will have to explain why we can't play. 
                   I will have to tell them to be quiet today.</p>
                 <p>My Papa, his thick hands and thick shoes, who wakes up tired 
                   in the dark, who combs his hair with water, drinks his coffee, and is gone before 
                   we wake, today is sitting on my bed.</p>
                 <p>And I think if my own Papa died what would I do. I hold Papa 
                   in my arms. I hold him and hold him.</p>
                 <p>&nbsp;</p>
                 <h2>&quot;Alicia Who Sees Mice&quot;</h2>
                 <p>Close your eyes and they'll go away, her father says, or, you're 
                   just imagining. And anyway, a woman's place is sleeping so she can wake up early 
                   with the tortilla star, the one that appears early just in time to rise and 
                   catch the hind legs hidden behind the sink, beneath the four clawed tub, under 
                   the swollen floorboards nobody fixes, in the corner of your eyes.</p>
                 <p>Alicia, whose mama died, is sorry there is no one older to rise 
                   and make the lunchbox tortillas. Alicia, who inherited her mama's rolling pin 
                   and sleepiness, is young and smart and studies for the first time at the university. 
                   Two trains and a bus, because she doesn't want to spend her whole life in a 
                   factory or behind a rolling pin. Is a good girl, my friend, studies all night 
                   and sees the mice, the ones her father says do not exist. Is afraid of nothing 
                   except four legged fur and fathers.</p>
